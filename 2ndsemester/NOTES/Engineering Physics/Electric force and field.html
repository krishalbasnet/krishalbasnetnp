              Important Results obtained from experiment by Du Fay & Gray :-

                  The transmission of electric charges to the ground is called
                  "The Earthing", where the Earth is assured as the sea of
                  charge.

                  There are two types of materials on the basis of transmission
                  of charges: which are "conductor" such as metal and
                  "insulator" such as glass, amber, plastics etc.

                  Two types of charges can be classified. It was further
                  confirmed by pith-ball experiments. Such as electric field
                  glass rubbed with fur produced "positive charge" and "negative
                  charge" to that on ebonite rod rubbed with silk.

            Nature of Electric Charges
            <p class="noteppppp">
              According to charge quantization, any charged particle can have a
              charge equal to some integral number of e, <br> i.e. Q=ne,  <br />
              where n=1, 2, 3,â€¦. <br />and, e is the value of charge on the
              electron.

                  The transmission of electric charges to the ground is called
                  "The Earthing", where the Earth is assured as the sea of
                  charges.

                <li>
                  There are two types of materials on the basis of transmission
                  of charges: which are "conductor" such as metal and
                  "insulator" such as glass, amber, plastics etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Two types of charges can be classified. It was further
                  confirmed by pith-ball experiments. Such as electric field
                  glass rubbed with fur produced "positive charge" and "negative
                  charge" to that on ebonite rod rubbed with silk.

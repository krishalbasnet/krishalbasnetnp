                                The Earth's crust is the outermost layer of our planet, a relatively thin, solid shell
                                compared to the much larger mantle and core beneath it. It's the part we interact with
                                directly, where continents and oceans are formed, and where life exists.
                                <br>

                                Primarily composed of silicate minerals, the crust is quite heterogeneous, with varying
                                mineral compositions and densities. There are two main types: continental crust, thicker
                                and less dense, primarily made up of granite; and oceanic crust, thinner and denser,
                                mainly composed of basalt.
                                <br>
                                The Earth's crust is divided into large, rigid plates that move slowly over the
                                underlying mantle. This movement, known as plate tectonics, is responsible for many
                                geological phenomena, including earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, and the
                                formation of continents and oceans.
                                <br>
                                Geologists use various techniques to study the crust, such as seismology, drilling, and
                                geophysical surveys. By understanding the Earth's crust, they can gain insights into the
                                planet's history, current dynamics, and future evolution.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Mantle-></b>
                                The mantle is the middle layer of the Earth, situated between the crust above and the
                                core below. It's the thickest layer of the planet, making up about 84% of Earth's total
                                volume.
                                <br>
                                The mantle is primarily composed of silicate rocks, which are rich in magnesium and
                                iron. These rocks are under immense pressure and temperature, causing them to behave in
                                a unique way. While the upper mantle is relatively rigid, the lower mantle is believed
                                to be more fluid-like, allowing for the movement of tectonic plates.
                                <br>
                                The mantle plays a crucial role in Earth's geological processes. It drives plate
                                tectonics, which is responsible for the formation of continents, oceans, mountains, and
                                earthquakes. Additionally, the mantle is the source of magma that rises to the surface
                                to form volcanoes.
                                <br>
                                Studying the mantle is essential to understanding the Earth's internal structure, its
                                evolution, and the processes that shape our planet's surface. Geologists use various
                                techniques, such as seismology and geophysics, to investigate the mantle's properties
                                and dynamics.

                                    <li><b>Outer Core-></b>
                                        The outer core is the layer of the Earth that lies between the mantle and the
                                        inner core. It's a thick, liquid layer composed primarily of iron and nickel,
                                        with smaller amounts of other elements like sulfur and oxygen.
                                        <br>
                                        The outer core is incredibly hot, with temperatures estimated to be between
                                        4,000 and 5,000 degrees Celsius (7,232 to 9,032 degrees Fahrenheit). This
                                        intense heat causes the iron and nickel to melt, creating a fluid layer.
                                        <br>
                                        The outer core's movement is believed to be responsible for generating the
                                        Earth's magnetic field. As the molten iron and nickel flow, they create electric
                                        currents, which in turn produce a magnetic field. This magnetic field is
                                        essential for protecting life on Earth from harmful solar radiation.
                                        <br>
                                        Studying the outer core is challenging due to its inaccessibility. However,
                                        scientists can infer its properties by analyzing seismic waves and the Earth's
                                        magnetic field. These observations provide valuable insights into the planet's
                                        internal structure and dynamics.

                                    <li><b>Inner Core-></b>
                                        The inner core is the innermost layer of the Earth, located at the planet's
                                        center. It's a solid sphere composed primarily of iron and nickel, with trace
                                        amounts of other elements.
                                        <br>
                                        The inner core is extremely hot, with temperatures estimated to be around 5,400
                                        degrees Celsius (9,752 degrees Fahrenheit). It's also under immense pressure,
                                        due to the weight of the overlying layers. These extreme conditions cause the
                                        iron and nickel to solidify, despite the high temperature.
                                        <br>
                                        The inner core is believed to have formed billions of years ago as the Earth
                                        cooled down. Its rotation is slightly different from that of the rest of the
                                        planet, which is thought to generate the Earth's magnetic field.
                                        <br>
                                        Studying the inner core is challenging due to its inaccessibility. However,
                                        scientists can infer its properties by analyzing seismic waves generated by
                                        earthquakes. These waves travel through the Earth's interior, providing clues
                                        about the composition and structure of the inner core.

                        Mountains are landforms that rise significantly above the surrounding terrain. They are
                        typically characterized by their steep slopes and high elevations. Mountains can be formed
                        through various geological processes, including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Plate tectonics: When two tectonic plates collide, the crust can be forced upwards,

                        Mountains play a crucial role in the Earth's climate, ecosystems, and human civilization. They
                        influence precipitation patterns, provide habitats for diverse plant and animal species, and

                        testament to the power of plate tectonics. This geological theory explains how the Earth's
                        outermost layer is divided into large, rigid plates that move slowly over time.
                        <br>
                        The formation of the Himalayas is a direct result of a continental collision. Millions of years
                        ago, the Indian Plate, moving northward, collided with the Eurasian Plate. As these massive
                        landmasses pressed against each other, the Earth's crust was forced upward, creating the
                        towering peaks we see today. This process, known as orogeny, is responsible for the formation of
                        many of the world's major mountain ranges.
                        <br>
                        The ongoing collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates continues to shape the Himalayas.
                        The pressure exerted by these plates causes earthquakes and other geological activity in the
                        region. Over time, the Himalayas will continue to rise, though at a much slower rate than in the
                        past.

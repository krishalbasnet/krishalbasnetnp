            <div class="notemaintext">Surveying is defined as the art of determining the relative position of various
                points on, above or below the surface of the earth with the help of Linear and Angular measurements,
                both horizontal and vertical and presentation of these information either graphically or numerically.

                        <b>Working from whole to the part:</b>
                        <p>
                            According to the first principle, the whole area is first enclosed by main
                            stations (controlling stations) and main survey lines (controlling lines).
                            The area is then divided into a number of parts by forming
                            well-conditioned triangles. The main survey lines are measured very
                            accurately with a standard chain and then the sides of triangles are measured.
                            <br>
                            The purpose of this process of working is to prevent accumulation of
                            error. During this procedure, if there is any error in the measurement
                            of any side of a triangle, then it will not affect the whole work. The
                            error can always be detected and eliminated. <br>
                            But, if the reverse process (from the part to the whole) is followed,
                            then the minor error in measurement will be magnified in the process
                            of expansion and these errors will become absolutely uncontrollable.

                            The relative position of various points (say point C) in survey works
                            can be easily be located from two known fixed points (say A and B)
                            by only one of the methods below:

          <li>Winners and losers have same goals.</li>
          <li>Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.</li>
          <li>Goals restrict your happiness.</li>
          <li>Goals are at odd with long-term progress.</li>
          <li>
            Habits are compund interest of self-improvement. Getting 1% better

          <li>
            Habits are double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you,
            which is why understanding the details is essential.
          </li>
          <li>
            Small changes often appears to make no difference until you cross a
            critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compunding
            process are delayed. You need to be patient.
          </li>
          <li>
            An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system.
            Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits
            are the building blocks of remarkable results.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus
            on your system instead.
          </li>
          <li>
            You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of
            your system.

        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons:
            <ul>
              <li>We try to change the wrong thing.</li>
              <li>We try to change our habit in the wrong way.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Outcomes are about what you get, processes are about what you do and
            identity is about what you believe.
          </li>
          <li>
            The ultimate form of motivation is when a habit becomes part of your
            identity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once your pride gets involved, you'll fight tooth and nail to
            maintain your habits.
          </li>
          <li>True behaviour change is identity change.</li>
          <li>Your behaviours are usually a reflection of your identity.</li>
          <li>
            Good Habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your
            identity, you will fail to put them in action.
          </li>
          <li>
            The more ypu repeat a behaviour, the more you reinforce the identity
            associated with that behaviour.
          </li>
          <li>Your identity is literally your "repeated beingness".</li>
          <li>
            The process of building habits is actually the process of building
            yourself.
          </li>
          <li>
            The process of building habits is actually the process of building
            yourself.
          </li>
          <li>We change day by day, bit by bit, habit by habit.</li>
          <li>Meaningful change doesn't require radical change.</li>
          <li>
            Your Habits matter because they help you become the type of person
            you wish to be.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change,
            and identity change.
          </li>
          <li>
            The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what
            you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become
          </li>
          <li>
            Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for
            the type of person you wish to become.
          </li>
          <li>
            Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously
            edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity
          </li>
          <li>
            The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better
            results (although tey can do that); but because they can change your
            beliefs about yourself.
          </li>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Behaviours followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated
            and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be
            repeated.
          </li>
          <li>The process of habit formation begins with trial and error.</li>
          <li>
            The feedback loop behind all human behaviour: try, fail, learn, try
            differently.
          </li>
          <li>
            The primary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict
            what will work in the future.
          </li>
          <li>Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it.</li>
          <li>
            The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple
            steps: cue, craving, response and reward.
          </li>
          <li>The cue triggers yout brain to initiate a behavior.</li>
          <li>Cravings are the motivational force behind every habit.</li>
          <li>
            Response is the actual habit you perform, which can take he form of
            a thought or an action.
          </li>
          <li>Reward are the end goal of every habit.</li>
          <li>A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.</li>
          <li>The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problem of life as little energy and effort as possible.</li>
          <li>Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response and reward.</li>

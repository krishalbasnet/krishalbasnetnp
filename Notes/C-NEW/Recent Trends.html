                <li>Programming paradigms: Procedural, structural and object oriented</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Procedural Programming is a programming paradigms in which the program is divided into
                        procedures, which are also known as routines or functions, simply containing a series of steps
                        to be carried out. eg. BASIC, C, FORTRAN, Java, etc.</li>
                    <li>Structured programming (modular programming) is a programming paradigm that is creation of
                        programs with readable code and reusable code and reusable components.</li>
                    <li>Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to languages that use objects in programming, they use
                        objects as a primary source to implement what is to happen in the code. eg. C++, Java, C#, etc.

                <li>Features of OOP</li>
                <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
                    <li>Object → In object-oriented programming (OOP), an object is a fundamental building block that
                        represents a real-world entity, such as a person, car, or bank account. It encapsulates both
                        attributes (characteristics or properties) and behaviors (actions or methods) that define its
                        identity and functionality. Objects are created based on a class, which serves as a blueprint or
                        template for creating multiple instances of objects with similar attributes and behaviors.
                        Through objects, OOP allows for modular design, code reusability, and the organization of data
                        and methods.</li>
                    <li>Class → In OOP, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and
                        behaviors that an object should have. It allows for code reusability and modular design. Each
                        instance of a class can have unique attribute values while accessing the same set of methods
                        defined in the class.</li>
                    <li>Data Abstraction → Data abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP) involves hiding the
                        internal details of an object and exposing only the essential features. It simplifies code,
                        promotes modularity, and enhances maintainability. By abstracting away unnecessary
                        implementation details, developers can create classes that provide a simplified interface for
                        interacting with objects, leading to more organized and maintainable code.</li>
                    <li>Encapsulation → Encapsulation in object-oriented programming (OOP) is the bundling of data and
                        methods within a class, such that the data is hidden from the outside world and can only be
                        accessed and modified through defined methods. This provides data protection and ensures that
                        the internal implementation details of an object are hidden, promoting code organization and
                        modularity.</li>
                    <li>Polymorphism → Polymorphism is a key feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows
                        objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the
                        same method to be invoked on different objects, resulting in different behaviors based on the
                        object's specific implementation. Polymorphism promotes code flexibility, reusability, and
                        extensibility by enabling the use of generic code that can work with objects of different types.
                    </li>
                    <li>Inheritance → Inheritance is a key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where a class
                        can inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It allows for the creation of a
                        hierarchy of classes, with more specialized classes inheriting characteristics from more general
                        classes. This promotes code reuse and modularity, as common attributes and methods can be
                        defined in a base class and inherited by derived classes. Inheritance facilitates the
                        organization and structuring of code in OOP. The types of Inheritance are:-
                        <ul style="list-style: lower-roman;">
                            <li>Single Inheritance → Single inheritance is a type of inheritance in object-oriented
                                programming where a class can inherit properties and behaviors from only one parent
                                class.</li>
                            <li>Multiple Inheritance → Multiple inheritance is a type of inheritance in object-oriented
                                programming where a class can inherit properties and behaviors from more than one parent
                                class, allowing for the combination of features from multiple sources.</li>
                            <li>Hierarchical Inheritance → Hierarchical inheritance is a type of inheritance in
                                object-oriented programming where multiple derived classes inherit properties and
                                behaviors from a single base or parent class.</li>
                            <li>Multilevel Inheritance → Multilevel Inheritance is a type of inheritance in
                                object-oriented programming where a derived class inherits properties and behaviors from
                                a parent class, which in turn inherits from another parent class.</li>
                            <li>Hybrid Inheritance → It is the combination of two or more types of inheritance. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol><hr>
                <li>Advantages of OOP</li>
                <ul>
                    → The advantages of OOP:
                    <li>Modularity: OOP allows for modular design, making it easier to organize and manage code. Classes
                        and objects can be created independently and combined to form larger systems.</li>
                    <li>Code Reusability: With OOP, code can be easily reused. Objects and classes can be created once
                        and used multiple times in different parts of the program, reducing duplication and promoting
                        efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Flexibility and Extensibility: OOP provides flexibility and extensibility. New features and
                        functionality can be added to existing code without modifying the existing codebase, making it
                        easier to adapt and enhance the system.</li>
                    <li>Data Protection: Encapsulation in OOP allows for data hiding and protection. By encapsulating
                        data within objects, access to the data can be controlled and restricted, ensuring data
                        integrity and security.</li>
                    <li>Easy Maintenance: OOP promotes code organization and modularity, making it easier to maintain
                        and debug code. Changes or updates can be made to individual classes or objects without
                        affecting the entire system.</li>
                </ul><hr>
                <li>Application of OOP</li>
                <ul>
                    → The application of OOP are:-

                <li>High Level Programming Languages</li>
                <ul>→ High-level programming languages (HLLs) bridge the gap between human thought and machine
                    execution. Unlike low-level languages that directly manipulate hardware, HLLs offer abstraction.
                    They use familiar concepts like variables, functions, and objects, hiding the complexity of memory
                    management and instruction sets. This increases readability and reduces development time.
                    Additionally, HLLs are platform-independent thanks to translation processes like compilation or
                    interpretation, making programs more portable. This focus on logic allows programmers to express
                    their ideas clearly, facilitating problem-solving instead of hardware optimization. Popular HLLs
                    like Python, Java, and C++ cater to diverse needs, from web development to game creation. Choosing
                    the right one depends on your project, experience, and desired features. In essence, HLLs empower
                    developers to create complex programs efficiently, acting as intermediaries between human thought
                    and the digital world.</ul>
